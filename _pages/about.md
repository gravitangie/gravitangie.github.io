Hello! I am a PhD student in theoretical physics affiliated to the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and to the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague. 

My research involves the **gravitational waves** (GWs) emitted by **black hole binaries**. In particular, I am dealing with waveform modelling within the <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/479939">effective-one-body</a> (EOB) approach. This approach provides a powerful semi-analytical framework that allows to evaluate reliable GW templates for compact binary coalescences. 

My current work aims at extending the validity of the EOB model <a href="https://teobresums.bitbucket.io">TEOBResumS</a> to the large-mass-ratio regime, in view of the needs of the next generation of GW detectors.

On this website you can find the list of my publications, the list of my talks and my cv. Click <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=find%20a%20Angelica%20Albertini%20and%20not%20collaboration%20%2A&ui-citation-summary=true">here</a> to see my research metrics on iNSPIRE.
